    Problem 3

    https://projecteuler.net/problem=3

    The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
    What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?
	
	
	
	Generalized to find the largest prime factor of N.
	Not optimized very well; uses trial divisions but tries to minimize the amount of divisions as much as possible.
