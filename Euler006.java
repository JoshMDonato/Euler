    Problem 6

    https://projecteuler.net/problem=6

    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
    3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
	
	
	
	When dealing with the first N natural numbers, known formulas can be used and combined.
	This allows the problem to be solved in O(1) time.
